# hello-world
The aardvark (Orycteropus afer) is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to Africa.

I usually choose Aardvark as my username when signing up for services, and have been doing so ever since I wanted to come first on the alphabetized list of accounts on the household xbox years ago.

I now have a pet peeve about people confusing anteaters and aardvarks.
